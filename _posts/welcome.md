# Welcome to My Notion-Like Blog!

This is my first post. I'm building this blog to look and feel like Notion.

## Features

-   **Markdown-based**: All posts are simple Markdown files.
-   **Dynamic Loading**: No need to rebuild the site. Just add a new `.md` file.
-   **Notion Style**: Clean and minimal design.

## Code Example

Here is a simple JavaScript code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
